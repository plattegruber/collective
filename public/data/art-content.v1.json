    "description": "The protagonist of Amy Cutler’s beautifully rendered 9-color lithograph, made in an edition of 50, appears to have packed in a hurry—her suitcases are bursting at the seams. Meanwhile, she’s used her own head as a stepping stool to take an improvised seat on top of a barrel. From the look of it, her body has set out on an impromptu journey, to the consternation of her head. Whether the scene is a regretful memory, a warning against extemporaneity, or a reminder of the humor in folly, we can all relate."
