    "materials": "Gouache and gel pen on paper",
    "description": "This piece was purchased during Jewelya Coffey’s MFA Thesis exhibition at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Created as part of her graduate body of work, it reflects Coffey’s exploration of narrative, folklore, and layered symbolism through richly patterned surfaces and surreal imagery. Her thesis works often investigate themes of play, guardianship, and transformation, expressed through dreamlike compositions that blur the line between the whimsical and the uncanny."

    "title": "Opal's Departure",
    "artist": "Amy Cutler",
    "year": 2011,
    "materials": "Lithograph, offset printed",
    "description": "Opal’s Departure is a 9-color lithograph by Amy Cutler, created in an edition of 50. Known for her meticulously detailed and narrative-driven prints and drawings, Cutler often stages fantastical scenes that blur the boundaries between the everyday and the surreal. In this work, the protagonist appears to have hastily overpacked, her suitcases bursting as she balances on a barrel with the aid of her own head. The image suggests both humor and unease—whether a playful warning against impulsiveness, a memory of regret, or simply a reminder of the absurdity we all recognize in ourselves."
